title: The (de)biasing effect of GAN-based augmentation methods
summary: This work explores unconditional and conditional GANs to compare their bias inheritance and how the synthetic data influence the models. We provide extensive manual data annotation of possibly biasing artifacts on the well-known ISIC dataset with skin lesions. In addition, we examine classification models trained on both real and synthetic data with counterfactual bias explanations. Our experiments show that GANs inherit biases and sometimes even amplify them, leading to even stronger spurious correlations. Manual data annotation and synthetic images will be publicly available for reproducible scientific research.
